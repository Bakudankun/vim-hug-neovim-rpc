# vim-hug-neovim-rpc

This is an experimental project. I started this project because I want to fix
the [vim8 support](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-completion-manager/issues/14)
issue for
[nvim-completion-manager](https://github.com/roxma/nvim-completion-manager).

Since this is a general perpurse module, other plugins needing rpc support may
benefits from this project. However, there're many neovim rpc methods I havn't
implemented yet, which make this an experimental plugin. Please fork and open
a PR if you get ideas on improvement.
